Quiz Application
This is an interactive Quiz Application designed to test users' knowledge through multiple-choice questions. The application is built with a flexible JSON-based question format that allows easy addition and modification of quiz questions.

Features
Multiple-choice questions
The quiz displays one question at a time, each with four possible answers. Questions and answers are stored in a structured JSON format for easy management.

Score Tracking
At the end of the quiz, the application shows the user's total score along with a percentage to provide feedback on performance.

Timer for Each Question
Each question comes with a countdown timer, adding a time challenge to encourage quick thinking. If the timer expires, the quiz automatically moves to the next question.

This project helps in reinforcing learning, self-assessment, and can be easily extended with additional questions or features.
